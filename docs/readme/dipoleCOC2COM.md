* Usage:
	
	```shell
	python dipoleCOC2COM.py gau.out
	```

* Intro:

	Dipole moment in Gaussian output is represented in center of nuclei charge (COC) origin. This needs to be converted to center of mass (COM) origin in order to compare with Tinker output. It is worth mentioning that dipole moments of nuetral molecules are invariant of origins.
