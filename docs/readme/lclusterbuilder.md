* Usage:

	```shell
	lclusterbuilder.py [-h] -mols MOLECULES [MOLECULES ...] -nm NMOLECULE -nc NCLUSTER -f FILENAME [-spn SPIN] [-chg CHARGE] [-method METHOD] [-grid GRIDSIZE]
	```

* Intro:
	
	This program is used to build molecular trimers and tetramers with monomer being provided. These structures are then subject to force field and quantum optimizations. Finally the low-energy structures are obtained.
